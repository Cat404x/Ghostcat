I was unable to fetch the workflow logs and the file content. Please ensure that the workflow file and the script file exist in the repository.

Here are the steps you can follow to manually fix and upload your script:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Cat404x/Ghostcat.git
   cd Ghostcat
   ```

2. **Create or update the script**:
   Create a new file or update the existing file `ghost_cat.py` with the corrected script.

3. **Stage the changes**:
   ```sh
   git add ghost_cat.py
   ```

4. **Commit the changes**:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Fix Ghost Cat script"
   ```

5. **Push the changes**:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

If you need specific help with fixing the code, please provide the code or the error messages you are encountering.
