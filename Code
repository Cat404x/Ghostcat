This script does the following:

1. Network scanning: Uses ARP requests to discover devices on the network.
2. Connection monitoring: Sets up a simple server to detect incoming connection attempts.
3. Logging: Records activities and findings to a log file.

To run this script, you'll need to install the Scapy library:

```
pip install scapy
```

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and should only be used for educational purposes. Real cybersecurity tools are much more complex and require careful consideration of legal and ethical implications. Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning networks or monitoring
Certainly! I'd be happy to provide you with the commands to run the "Ghost Cat" cybersecurity tool script. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script is written in Python and requires Python 3.x.

2. Install the required library (Scapy) if you haven't already:
   ```
   pip install scapy
   ```

3. Save the Python script to a file, for example, `ghost_cat.py`.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

5. To run the script, use the following command:
   ```
   python ghost_cat.py
   ```

6. Once the script is running, you'll see a menu with options. Here's how to use each option:

   - To scan a network:
     Enter '1' when prompted, then input an IP range like '192.168.1.0/24'

   - To monitor connections:
     Enter '2' when prompted, then input a port number to monitor

   - To exit the program:
     Enter '3'

7. For the enhanced version with command-line arguments:

   - To scan a network:
     ```
     python ghost_cat.py -s 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

   - To monitor a specific port:
     ```
     python ghost_cat.py -m 8080
     ```

   - To sniff network traffic on a specific interface:
     ```
     python ghost_cat.py -i eth0
     ```

   - To see all available options:
     ```
     python ghost_cat.py -h
     ```

Remember, you may need to run the script with administrator/root privileges for some operations, especially network scanning and packet sniffing. On Unix-like systems, you can use `sudo`:

```
sudo python ghost_cat.py
```

Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and are complying with all relevant laws and regulations when using this tool. It should only be used on networks and systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
